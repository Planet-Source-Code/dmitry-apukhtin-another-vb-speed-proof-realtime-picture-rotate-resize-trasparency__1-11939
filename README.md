### Description

Ok, guys, this time no Assembler tricks, just pure VB code. Well, a little tricky DIB-processing, but still pure VB. Making pretty impressive results: 60+ FPS (PII-400/TNT2, on included bitmaps - btw, try to replace them by yours), proving that VB is fast enough. It's all about truecolor image processing.

I commented the code as best as I can and hope to hear some feedbacks from you. Again, let me know what FPS do you have. And, please, don't try to measure it in 256 colors mode.
